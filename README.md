# Client-Server Messenger

This is my first ever Java project which i built taking reference from this Youtube channel [thenewboston](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJbPGzawDH1njbqV-D5HqKw). It is a simple client-server messaging system which can be used to communicate between local client and a remote server using java sockets and streams.
